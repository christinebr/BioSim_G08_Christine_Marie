Animal
===========
This module represents animals. There are two types of animals:
herbivores and carnivores, which are represented with subclasses
Herbivore and Carnivore. These are subclasses of the general
Animal class. Both herbivores and carnivores have lists of
parameters, which can be changed by the user. The animal class
provides data on the probability for dying, giving birth and
migrating, it also keeps track of weight, age and fitness
of animals.
