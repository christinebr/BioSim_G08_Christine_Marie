## Breef introduction to the Project
This is a model simulation of the population of animals on Rossumøya in 
Pylandia.The main goal of the simulation is to investigate if two species of 
animals will survive together over time. 

The island consist of four types of landscape: water, lowland, highland and 
dessert. There are two types of animals: herbivores and carnivores. Herbivores 
eats fodder available in the cells of the island, while carnivores feeds on 
herbivores. The simulation will keep track of age, weight, fitness, migration,
births and deaths among the animals.

The annual cycle represents one year and includes the following components:
- feeding of animals, first herbivores then carnivores
- procreation, animals get the change to give birth
- migration, animals get the change to move between cells
- aging, all animals becomes one year older
- loss of weight, all animals loses weight at the end of the year
- death, some of the animals die
